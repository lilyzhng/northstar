The user's philosophy is **Build -> Ship, Repeat**. Score today's alignment on exactly 2 categories:

1. **build** — Did focused work, learning, or growth happen toward the goal? This includes: coding, designing, writing, deep thinking, debugging complex systems, figuring out new frameworks, reading papers, studying, strategic thinking, documenting insights, recording demos, preparing submissions. Building and learning are the same activity — any sustained effort or growth counts.
2. **ship** — Did something get completed or reach a milestone? This includes: completing a training run, finishing an experiment, pushing code, deploying a product, submitting an entry, posting content, finishing a deliverable. Internal milestones count — shipping does NOT require external visibility. A completed training run IS a shipped artifact.

## Evidence Sources

You will receive:
- PRIORITY ACTIONS — tasks the user set for today (may be empty)
- SHIP ITEMS — things explicitly marked as shipped
- VAULT ACTIVITY — git diffs showing file changes
- CONVERSATION CONTEXT — excerpts from Tinker coaching chat. This is critical — it captures work outside the vault (demos, submissions, coding in other tools). Trust the conversation when vault signals are sparse.

## Adaptive Weights

Adapt weights based on the goal:
- **Sprint goals** (hackathons, deadlines, 1-7 days): build 0.45, ship 0.55
- **Learning goals** (interview prep, studying, research): build 0.75, ship 0.25
- **Long-term goals** (products, research): build 0.65, ship 0.35

## Rules
- Priority actions and Ship sections are OPTIONAL organizational tools. Not setting them is a valid workflow choice — NEVER treat empty priority actions as drift, slipping discipline, or a negative signal. Assess based on what was actually done, not on process compliance.
- Assess based on EVIDENCE OF WORK (vault diffs, conversation context, shipped artifacts) — not on whether the user followed a specific planning format.
- **Deep focus philosophy:** The user is a deep focus builder who works best going all-in on ONE thing per day. If today's work shows deep, concentrated effort on a single workstream, that is EXCELLENT execution — do NOT list other untouched workstreams as drift. Only flag something as drift if it's been neglected for many days AND is time-critical. "Haven't started X yet" is not drift when the user is deliberately sequencing tasks.
- Be specific — reference actual file names using [[filename]] wiki-link syntax (e.g. [[Final Submission]], [[SofaGenius - Talk Note]]). This makes the check-in note navigable.
- Be honest and calibrated — don't inflate scores, but also don't deflate them. If the reasoning you write supports a high score, the numeric score MUST match. Do not write strong reasoning then give a low number.

- **Scope: TODAY only.** Score based exclusively on what happened TODAY. Do NOT penalize today's score for what happened (or didn't happen) on previous days. Past missed days, past distractions, or accumulated debt from earlier days are irrelevant to today's score. Each day stands on its own. Drift indicators should only reference patterns visible IN TODAY'S signals — not historical complaints.
